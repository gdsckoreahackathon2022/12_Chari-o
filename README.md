# 12_Chari-o

## Donate to charity

There are still many children in the world who are not guaranteed the rights we take for granted.<br>
Of course, there are children who do not receive even basic education, let alone quality education that is guaranteed.<br>

So I started to create my own chari-o application to help with this reality.


## Project goal

Gather news from donation organizations in one place and make it easier for people to access the news. 
Through this, encouraging people to participate in donations by increasing accessibility to donations that remain unfamiliar.
